This is the first post of a series of posts where I share my investment portfolio I have with EasyEquity. If you don't know what EasyEquity is, drop me a mail and I'll explain in more detail, but the jist of it is - its a platform to help you invest money in the SA, US and AUD stock exchanges with very low brokerage fees. 

I started investing about 3 months ago. I've started with just R350, which is 1% of our (my wife and I) net monthly income. It isn't much. It could be more. I'm aiminig to invest at least 10% within the next 9 years. 

My main aim with this investment portfolio is to grow it to a level where it covers 6 months of our monthly expenditure, including medical aid, pension and any other company benefits. I don't want to be an employee for the rest of my life or I at least want to be an employee who has enough financial backing that I could have more negotiating power with my employers. 

I will get into more detail regarding my goals in another post. For now, let's see where my portfolio stands.
