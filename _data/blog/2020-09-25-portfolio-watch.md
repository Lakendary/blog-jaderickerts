# Portfolio Watch: 25 September 2020

It's been a while since I wrote a blog post about my portfolio. Life kind of got really busy this month and I am currently going through a slump. But that is no excuse. I have to stick to a schedule and make sure I post on time, whether the blog post is perfect or not.

## New Blogging Format

I've decided that I'll split my *learning* posts from my portfolio watch posts because combining them makes for a very long blog post. This takes a lot of time and delays the process of getting a blog post out in time. 

So one week I'll give an update on my portfolio. The following week I will do some research into an investment topic and write about what I've learned.

## The portfolio (before buying)

Things aren't looking too great with my portfolio. There was one point last week where every single one of my ETFs were in RED. I then decided that I needed to step back from my portfolio otherwise the negative numbers could impact my mood and lead to me making foolish decisions.

This worked well for me so far but I have to return to my portfolio to decide what are my next batch of stocks or ETFs to buy. 

## Increase in my monthly investments

I am part of the fortune minority of people who got a raise during these COVID-19 times. I am very thankful to be working for a company that wasn't affected too negatively by this pandemic. In fact, some would say we benefited a great deal. But nothing to the degree of say Netflix, Microsoft or Amazon. 

This increase in salary means I can put more money into my portfolio. I started with R150, moved to R350 a month or two later. Now I'm going to invest R750 per month. I initially wanted to invest R1,000 but there are other areas of my budget that needs some money as well. R750 is not too bad. 

This means that I am currently investing 2% of our nett income every month. My goal is to get that figure all the way up to 10%. This excludes other savings my wife and I make on a monthly basis. We save for repairs and maintenance, emergencies and clothing.

## My strategy this month

I still plan on having a 4:1 split in my portfolio of ETFs to Equity. Currently it's at about 1.8:1. So I want to put the entire R750 in ETFs. But the Multichoice Group loss is bothering me a lot. I lost about 16% in value of my Multichoice shares.

My thinking is that I can buy more Multichoice stock, now that it's 16% less than my original investment. This should lower my average purchase price. Then the stock price doesn't have to go up that much for me to realise a profit and for me to sell it off. I don't plan on keeping the Multichoice for long. I only bought it because I heard they will pay dividends. I got my divends. It was about R8.

This already looks a bit better by just buying more of the stuff I'm already making losses on. LOL. I know, this is all down to a small gain I made between the time I took the two screenshots.

Besides the Multichoice stock, I bought a number of ETFs. This brings my ETF to Equity ratio to 2.33:1, closer to my target of 4:1. It will take me at least 2 months to get where I want to be. I spent R150 on each stock or ETF. So I bought one equity and 4 ETFs.

This is already a long post. I'll share more details on the ETFs I purchased. That's it for now. Until next time. Thanks for reading.
