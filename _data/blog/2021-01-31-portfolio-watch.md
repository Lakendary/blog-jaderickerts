# Portfolio Watch: 31 January 2021

New year, new me. Just kidding, but I want to write about personal finances on a regular basis. Life gets so busy that important things like writing a blog post fall by the wayside, but I refuse to give up on this blog. I am committing, to one post per month and even if I don't achieve that goal, at least there should be a couple of posts to look back on in a year's time.

## My portfolio

_Insert screenshot of portfolio here_

My portfolio is split 4:1 between ETFs and Equity, so each month I divide my investments in that ratio. So I buy 1 equity each month and 4 ETFs.

I'm pretty much set with my current ETFs. It is well diversified. I've got ETFs for the South African Market, Chinese market, Japanese market and the American market. I'm missing out on Europe. Now that the dust has settled on Brexit, it might be time to look into the European markets.

As for my equity, I'm set with the current ones as well. I'm looking for growth here and some dividends are a bonus to be re-invested in my portfolio. Only once I've hit my goal of investing six times my monthly salary, will I start selling my growth stock for dividend stocks.

## Stocks purchased this month

1. City Lodge Hotels Limited - 66.6913 shares for R 2.98 per share (R200.00 total)
2. Sygnia MSCI Japan - 11.6719 shares for R 17.07 per share (R200.00 total)
3. Satrix S&P 500 ETF - 3.3301 shares for R 59.90 per share (R200.23 total)
4. Satrix MSCI China Feeder Portfolio - 3.3838 shares for R 58.88 per share (R200.00 total)
5. Satrix Nasdaq 100 Feeder Portfolio - 1.7485 shares for R 113.95 per share (R200.00 total)

The strategy was simple this month. Spend R200 on my four lowest returning ETFs. I reckon I need to lower the average purchase price of stock so that when there are gains in the markets, I see maximal growth. In other words, buy low.

As for City Lodge Hotels Limited, this was another tip I got from a friend of mine. The same one who gave me the tips on MTN and Woolworths. This is a gamble that I hope pays off. The price of City Lodge Hotels is low compared to the pre-COVID-19 price. But things look bad in South Africa at the moment with restrictions on travel. It could very well be that City Lodge Hotels will never recover from this.
