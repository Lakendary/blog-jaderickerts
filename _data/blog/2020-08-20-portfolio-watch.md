## Portfolio Watch: 20 August 2020

Each week I'll try to learn something new about investments and apply that to my own portfolio.

## Earnings Per Share

Earning per share is a financial ratio that shows how much profit each share earned. This should give you an idea on how much money you could earn from owning that share. But this doesn't really tell you much on it's own. This ratio must be compared to the earnings per share (EPS) of other listed companies in the same industry.

## Price Earnings Ratio

The other challenge with comparing companies, even in the same industry, they still differ in a number of factors. The Price Earnings Ratio tries to put companies on an equal footing by factoring in the price of the share. This ratio is used together with EPS.

## FirstRand - my stock
